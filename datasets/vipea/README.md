## Vipea Dataset
This dataset was created as described in [Aldeghi & Coley (2022) "A graph representation of molecular ensembles for polymer property prediction"](#). The file `dataset.csv` contains the information on all copolymers and associated electron affinities (EA) and ionization potentials (IP), which are used to generate input files used for the various ML models. Note that a slightly cleaner version of `dataset.csv` is provided as part of the Supplementary Information in the article above.


## Files
The folder `calculations` contains the results of the xTB calculation of the vertical IP and EA for all copolymers.

The folder `chemprop_inputs` contains the `csv` files used as input for Chemprop (both standard Chemprop, `dataset-master_chemprop.csv`, and the modified Polymer Chemprop, `dataset-polymer_chemprop*`). The files for the Polymer Chemprop ablation experiments are specified by the information in their file name: stoichiometry (`only_stoich`), chain architecture (`only_chain`). In addition, the input associated with the artificial datasets with inflated chain architecture importance are tagged with `poly_type_x5`; those with inflated stoichiometry importance are tagged with `comp_x5`.

The folder `rf_input` contains the fingerprint input for the RF models as pickle files. These are not available on GitHub due to their large size, but can be generated with the scripts provided. Binary and count fingerprints for the monomer representation are generated in `prepare-inputs.ipynb`; binary and count fingerprints for the polymer representation (i.e. with sequence sampling) are generated by `make-polymer-fps.py`.

The files `acids.csv` and `bromides.csv` contain the monomers used to create the dataset and were taken from [Bai et al. (2019) “Accelerated Discovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution from Water through the Integration of Experiment and Theory.”](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b03591).


The pickle files `cv10-random_split.pkl` and `cv9-monomer_split.pkl` contains the indices of the cross-validation splits used to train, validate, and test all models. These too can be generated with `prepare-inputs.ipynb`.
